## WHOOP Strap (2015) — display-less wrist/bicep PPG band for continuous HR/HRV, sleep and recovery (2015)

- **id**: `whoop-strap-2015`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: bracelet
- **creator**: WHOOP, Inc. (Will Ahmed)
- **disclosure**: WHOOP, Inc. 'WHOOP Strap', launched 2015 — a screenless band worn on the wrist or upper arm with photoplethysmography, a 3-axis accelerometer, and skin-temperature sensing, providing continuous heart rate, heart-rate variability, respiratory rate, sleep staging, and a derived 'recovery' score, with no on-device display.
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-skin-temperature
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-respiratory-rate, algo-sleep-staging, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a display-less band worn on the wrist or upper arm with PPG, accelerometry, and skin-temperature sensing that continuously derives HR, HRV, respiratory rate, and sleep stages and combines them into a daily 'recovery' index, with no screen (companion-app readout). Anticipates screenless-band claims and PPG-derived-HRV/recovery-score claims from 2015. Product-side anchor for the bracelet × PPG cross-cut and the HRV cross-cut.

## Oura Ring (Gen 1, 2015) — finger-ring PPG, skin-temperature and accelerometer for HRV, sleep and body temperature (2015-08)

- **id**: `oura-ring-gen1-2015`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: ring
- **creator**: Oura Health Oy
- **disclosure**: Oura Health Oy. 'Oura Ring' (1st generation), crowdfunded 2015, shipped 2016 — a titanium finger ring with infrared photoplethysmography, an NTC skin-temperature sensor, and a 3-axis accelerometer, deriving resting heart rate, heart-rate variability, respiratory rate, sleep staging, and body-temperature trend.
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-skin-temperature, sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-respiratory-rate, algo-sleep-staging
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a finger-ring wearable with infrared PPG, a skin-temperature sensor, and an accelerometer, deriving resting HR, HRV, respiratory rate, sleep stages, and a body-temperature trend, with companion-app readout. A commercial realization, ~12-16 years later, of the MIT ring-sensor concept ([[asada-mit-wearable-ring-sensor-2003]]); to the extent later claims recite ring-form PPG + skin-temperature + HRV/sleep, both Asada 2003 and Oura 2015 are prior art. Product-side anchor for the ring × PPG × HRV and ring × skin-temperature cross-cuts.

## VitalConnect VitalPatch (2016) — adhesive chest patch with single-lead ECG and multi-parameter monitoring (2016)

- **id**: `vitalconnect-vitalpatch-2016`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: patch
- **creator**: VitalConnect, Inc.
- **disclosure**: VitalConnect, Inc. 'VitalPatch' biosensor, FDA-cleared as a single-use adhesive chest patch with single-lead ECG, heart rate, heart-rate variability, respiratory rate, skin temperature, posture, activity, and fall detection, streamed wirelessly to a smartphone/relay; 7-day wear (later 14-day variants).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-skin-temperature
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-respiratory-rate, algo-activity-classification, algo-posture-detection, algo-fall-detection, algo-arrhythmia-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a single-use adhesive chest patch deriving single-lead ECG, HR, HRV, respiratory rate, skin temperature, posture, activity, and falls in one body-worn unit, streamed wirelessly — i.e. a packed multi-parameter vital-signs patch. Anticipates multi-parameter ECG-patch claims combining any subset of those measurements in one adhesive form factor from 2016. Product-side anchor for the patch × multi-parameter-vitals cross-cut alongside [[fda-k113862-irhythm-zio-patch-2011]] (the AFib-focused variant).

## Ultrahuman Ring AIR (2023) — smart ring with metabolic-focus tracking (PPG, skin temperature, IMU) (2023)

- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: ring
- **creator**: Ultrahuman Healthcare Pvt. Ltd.
- **disclosure**: Ultrahuman Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. 'Ultrahuman Ring AIR', launched 2023 — a titanium smart ring with infrared photoplethysmography, IR skin-temperature, and a 6-axis IMU, deriving HR, HRV, skin temperature, sleep staging, activity, and metabolic-health framing (paired with the company's CGM-based metabolism platform).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-skin-temperature, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-gyroscope
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-sleep-staging, algo-respiratory-rate
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a smart ring with IR PPG, skin-temperature, and a 6-axis IMU, deriving HR/HRV, sleep, and activity, packaged with a metabolic-health platform (CGM-linked). Product-side reference in the ring × PPG cross-cut alongside [[oura-ring-gen1-2015]] and [[samsung-galaxy-ring-2024]].

## Samsung Galaxy Ring (2024) — smart ring with PPG, skin temperature and accelerometer for HR/HRV, sleep and cycle tracking (2024-07-10)
