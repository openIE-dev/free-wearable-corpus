## Pantelopoulos & Bourbakis (2010) — survey on wearable sensor-based systems for health monitoring and prognosis (2010-01)

- **id**: `pantelopoulos-bourbakis-2010-wearable-health-survey`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: other
- **creator**: Alexandros Pantelopoulos / Nikolaos G. Bourbakis
- **disclosure**: Pantelopoulos A, Bourbakis NG. 'A survey on wearable sensor-based systems for health monitoring and prognosis.' IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews) 2010;40(1):1-12.
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-skin-temperature, sensor-respiration-impedance
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-arrhythmia-classification, algo-spo2-estimation, algo-fall-detection, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Surveys, as of 2010, the architecture and components of wearable health-monitoring systems — sensors (ECG, PPG, SpO2, accelerometry, temperature, respiration), garment- and patch- and watch-based form factors, on-body processing, wireless body-area networking, and the analytics (arrhythmia, fall, activity, deterioration prediction). Prior art establishing that the general 'multi-sensor wearable + body-area network + cloud analytics' system architecture and its building blocks were collected and published by 2010 — useful against later claims to the bare system architecture. General anchor.

## Bragi Dash (2014) — the first true 'hearable': in-ear PPG heart rate, accelerometer, storage and touch control inside wireless earbuds (2014-02-25)

- **id**: `bragi-dash-2014`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: earbud
- **creator**: Bragi GmbH
- **disclosure**: Bragi GmbH. 'The Dash' wireless smart earphones, crowdfunded February 2014 (shipped 2016) — fully wireless in-ear earbuds with a reflectance-PPG heart-rate sensor and oxygen-saturation estimation against the ear-canal wall, a 3-axis accelerometer (head-gesture and step/activity tracking), 4 GB onboard music storage, bone-conduction microphone, and capacitive touch control.
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-microphone-bone
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-spo2-estimation, algo-step-count, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses fully-wireless in-ear earbuds with a reflectance-PPG heart-rate and SpO2 sensor against the ear-canal wall, an accelerometer for head-gesture and step/activity tracking, onboard music storage, a bone-conduction microphone, and capacitive touch control — i.e. physiological sensing integrated into wireless earbuds. Anticipates hearable claims combining 'a wireless earbud housing', 'an in-ear PPG/SpO2 sensor', 'an accelerometer for activity or head gesture', and 'on-device media and controls' from 2014. Product-side anchor for the earbud × PPG cross-cut.

## HealthyPi Move (ProtoCentral, 2026) — open-source medical-grade smartwatch (2024)

- **id**: `healthypi-move-2026`
- **corpus**: open
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: ProtoCentral Electronics
- **disclosure**: ProtoCentral Electronics (Bengaluru, India). 'HealthyPi Move' fully open-source AMOLED smartwatch — Crowd Supply campaign launched 2024, units shipping 15 May 2026. Sensors: single-lead ECG, dual-site PPG (wrist + finger), SpO2, blood-pressure trending, EDA/GSR, heart rate, HRV, respiration rate (derived), body temperature, 6-axis IMU. Compute: Nordic nRF5340 (dual ARM Cortex-M33). Display: AMOLED, 300 mAh battery. Companion app: Flutter, runs on Android/iOS/macOS/Windows/Linux, all data stored locally. Hardware design, firmware (Zephyr RTOS on nRF Connect SDK), and companion app all open-source. https://www.crowdsupply.com/protocentral/healthypi-move
- **ip status**: open-permissive
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-multi-wavelength-ppg, sensor-gsr, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-gyroscope, sensor-skin-temperature
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-spo2-estimation, algo-respiratory-rate, algo-pwv-bp-estimation, algo-sleep-staging, algo-activity-classification, algo-step-count
- **prior art notes**: Discloses, as fully open-source hardware and firmware (CC and MIT-style licensing across components), a wrist-worn smartwatch with the full consumer-medical sensor stack: single-lead ECG between back-of-watch electrode and a finger-touch electrode; multi-wavelength reflectance PPG with SpO2 and BP-trending; EDA/GSR; skin temperature; 6-axis IMU; on-device Zephyr-RTOS application; AMOLED display; all-local data storage via cross-platform Flutter app. Anticipates wrist-multi-sensor-watch claims from 2024-2026 to the extent they recite combinations of these elements; as `open` prior art it is unencumbered and any patent claim reciting these combinations must distinguish over HealthyPi Move's specific implementation. The product-side anchor for the 'open watch with the full sensor stack' cross-cut.

## H-Watch (Magno et al., 2024) — open-source ARM Cortex-M4F + ML + NB-IoT + energy-harvesting research smartwatch (2024)

Prior art for symptom-monitoring smartwatch claims reciting any of those elements from 2024. Establishes that the cellular-connected open-hardware ML-enabled smartwatch is a published research design.
