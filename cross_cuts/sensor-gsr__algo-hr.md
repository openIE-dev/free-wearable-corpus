## Microsoft Band (2014) — ten-sensor wristband (optical HR, GPS, GSR, UV, skin temp, barometer, ambient light, capacitive, microphone, IMU) (2014-10-30)

- **id**: `microsoft-band-2014`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Microsoft Corp.
- **disclosure**: Microsoft Corp. 'Microsoft Band', released 30 October 2014 — a wristband integrating ten sensors: an optical (PPG) heart-rate sensor, a 3-axis accelerometer/gyroscope, GPS, an ambient-light sensor, a skin-temperature sensor, a UV sensor, a capacitive (wear-detection) sensor, a galvanic-skin-response sensor, a microphone, and a barometer (added in Band 2).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-gyroscope, sensor-skin-temperature, sensor-uv, sensor-gsr, sensor-barometer, sensor-photodiode-ambient, sensor-microphone-air
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-step-count, algo-calorie-estimation, algo-sleep-staging, algo-stress-index, algo-uv-dose-tracking
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a single wristband integrating an unusually broad sensor suite — reflectance-PPG HR, IMU, GPS, skin temperature, UV exposure, galvanic skin response (electrodermal activity), barometer, ambient light, capacitive wear-detection, and a microphone — feeding HR, activity, sleep, UV dose, and stress-index estimations. Prior art for multi-sensor-wristband claims reciting combinations of these sensors (notably wrist GSR/EDA + PPG + skin temperature for stress) from October 2014. Product-side anchor for the multi-sensor wristband cross-cut.

## HealthyPi Move (ProtoCentral, 2026) — open-source medical-grade smartwatch (2024)

- **id**: `healthypi-move-2026`
- **corpus**: open
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: ProtoCentral Electronics
- **disclosure**: ProtoCentral Electronics (Bengaluru, India). 'HealthyPi Move' fully open-source AMOLED smartwatch — Crowd Supply campaign launched 2024, units shipping 15 May 2026. Sensors: single-lead ECG, dual-site PPG (wrist + finger), SpO2, blood-pressure trending, EDA/GSR, heart rate, HRV, respiration rate (derived), body temperature, 6-axis IMU. Compute: Nordic nRF5340 (dual ARM Cortex-M33). Display: AMOLED, 300 mAh battery. Companion app: Flutter, runs on Android/iOS/macOS/Windows/Linux, all data stored locally. Hardware design, firmware (Zephyr RTOS on nRF Connect SDK), and companion app all open-source. https://www.crowdsupply.com/protocentral/healthypi-move
- **ip status**: open-permissive
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-multi-wavelength-ppg, sensor-gsr, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-gyroscope, sensor-skin-temperature
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-spo2-estimation, algo-respiratory-rate, algo-pwv-bp-estimation, algo-sleep-staging, algo-activity-classification, algo-step-count
- **prior art notes**: Discloses, as fully open-source hardware and firmware (CC and MIT-style licensing across components), a wrist-worn smartwatch with the full consumer-medical sensor stack: single-lead ECG between back-of-watch electrode and a finger-touch electrode; multi-wavelength reflectance PPG with SpO2 and BP-trending; EDA/GSR; skin temperature; 6-axis IMU; on-device Zephyr-RTOS application; AMOLED display; all-local data storage via cross-platform Flutter app. Anticipates wrist-multi-sensor-watch claims from 2024-2026 to the extent they recite combinations of these elements; as `open` prior art it is unencumbered and any patent claim reciting these combinations must distinguish over HealthyPi Move's specific implementation. The product-side anchor for the 'open watch with the full sensor stack' cross-cut.

## CogWatch (HardwareX, 2024) — open-source smartwatch for cognitive-load monitoring (2024)

- **id**: `cogwatch-2024-hardwarex`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: (See HardwareX publication for full author list.)
- **disclosure**: 'CogWatch: An open-source smartwatch platform for cognitive-load monitoring.' HardwareX 19 (2024). Open-source smartwatch design — full hardware, firmware, and assembly documentation published in the open-hardware-focused journal HardwareX (Elsevier). https://www.hardware-x.com/article/S2468-0672(24)00032-4/fulltext
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-gsr, sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-stress-index, algo-cognitive-workload
- **prior art notes**: Discloses, as open-hardware (HardwareX is the canonical venue for full publication of open-hardware designs), a wrist-worn smartwatch instrumented for cognitive-load monitoring from PPG-derived HRV and EDA/GSR. Prior art for smartwatch-cognitive-load claims combining 'a wrist-worn device', 'PPG and EDA sensors', and 'a derived cognitive-load metric' from 2024.
