# Intersection cross-cut: `sensor-multi-wavelength-ppg` ∩ `algo-hr`

Axes: **sensors × algorithms**

**3 corpus entries disclose both tags.**

Earliest disclosure: 1988-10

These entries are the direct inputs to [OBVIOUSNESS_TEMPLATE.md](../OBVIOUSNESS_TEMPLATE.html). Any patent claim combining these two elements is anticipated or rendered obvious by the chain below.

## Mendelson & Ochs (1988) — reflectance-mode pulse oximetry / skin-reflectance PPG (1988-10)

- **id**: `mendelson-ochs-1988-reflectance-pulse-oximetry`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: other
- **creator**: Yitzhak Mendelson / Burt D. Ochs
- **disclosure**: Mendelson Y, Ochs BD. 'Noninvasive pulse oximetry utilizing skin reflectance photoplethysmography.' IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 1988;35(10):798-805.
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-multi-wavelength-ppg
- **algorithms**: algo-spo2-estimation, algo-hr
- **prior art notes**: Establishes pulse oximetry by reflectance (light source and detector on the same side of the tissue) rather than transmission — the geometry every wrist, forehead, ring, chest, and earbud PPG/SpO2 wearable uses, since those sites cannot be transilluminated. Any wearable-SpO2 claim reciting 'a reflectance photoplethysmography sensor' or 'a light source and photodetector arranged on a common surface against the skin' reads on Mendelson & Ochs 1988. Anchor for the reflectance-PPG/SpO2 cross-cut on non-fingertip sites.

## Apple Watch (1st generation, 2015) — wrist green-PPG heart rate and activity (2015-04-24)

- **id**: `apple-watch-original-2015`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Apple Inc.
- **disclosure**: Apple Inc. 'Apple Watch', announced September 2014, available 24 April 2015 — a wrist-worn device with a green/infrared photoplethysmography heart-rate sensor against the dorsal wrist, accelerometer and gyroscope, and activity/exercise tracking.
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-multi-wavelength-ppg, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-gyroscope
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-step-count, algo-calorie-estimation, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a wristworn device with a dorsal-wrist green-LED photoplethysmography heart-rate sensor (with IR for low-perfusion conditions), inertial sensors, and continuous HR/activity tracking. Anticipates wristworn-PPG-HR claims to the extent they postdate April 2015; combined with the much earlier PPG principle ([[hertzman-1937-photoplethysmography]]) and wrist form factor, the combination is in any case obvious under [[obviousness-template]]. Product-side anchor for the watch × PPG cross-cut.

## Masimo W1 (2022) — first FDA-cleared continuous wrist medical-grade pulse oximetry watch (2022-05)

- **id**: `masimo-w1-2022`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Masimo Corp.
- **disclosure**: Masimo Corp. 'Masimo W1' health-tracking watch, announced May 2022 — a wrist-worn device performing continuous medical-grade pulse oximetry (SpO2), pulse rate, perfusion index (PI), pleth variability index (PVi), respiratory rate from the PPG, and HRV, using Masimo's SET/rainbow signal-extraction algorithms. (FDA cleared as a continuous-monitoring medical device.)
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-multi-wavelength-ppg, sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-spo2-estimation, algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-respiratory-rate
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a wrist-worn device performing continuous medical-grade pulse oximetry — SpO2, PR, perfusion index, PVi, RR-from-PPG, HRV — using established signal-extraction methods, distinguished from consumer spot-check SpO2 by continuous operation and clearance for medical use. Anticipates wrist-continuous-medical-SpO2 claims from 2022; the underlying two-wavelength SpO2 method is much older ([[aoyagi-1974-two-wavelength-pulse-oximetry]], [[mendelson-ochs-1988-reflectance-pulse-oximetry]], [[iso-80601-2-61-pulse-oximeter-equipment-2011]]). Product-side anchor for the watch × continuous-SpO2 cross-cut.
