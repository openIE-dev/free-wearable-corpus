- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: garment
- **creator**: Rita Paradiso / Giannicola Loriga / Nicola Taccini (Smartex / CNR, Italy; EU WEALTHY consortium)
- **disclosure**: Paradiso R, Loriga G, Taccini N. 'A wearable health care system based on knitted integrated sensors.' IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine 2005;9(3):337-344. (Output of the EU FP5 'WEALTHY' project, 2002-2005.)
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-respiration-impedance, sensor-piezoelectric, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-skin-temperature
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-respiratory-rate, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a smart shirt with electrodes and sensors knitted directly into the textile (conductive yarns forming dry ECG electrodes; piezoresistive yarns forming respiration sensors via thoracic/abdominal expansion; accelerometer; temperature) plus an on-garment electronic interface and wireless link, deriving ECG, heart rate, respiration, posture/activity, and temperature — i.e. a fully integrated textile-electrode wearable.
