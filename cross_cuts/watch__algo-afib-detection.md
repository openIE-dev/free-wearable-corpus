## AliveCor Heart Monitor / KardiaMobile (2012) — smartphone-coupled single-lead ECG (2012-12)

- **id**: `alivecor-kardiamobile-2012`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: other
- **creator**: AliveCor, Inc. (David Albert)
- **disclosure**: AliveCor, Inc. 'AliveCor Heart Monitor' (later 'KardiaMobile'), FDA-cleared December 2012 — a card-sized two-electrode module that records a single-lead ECG via dry electrodes touched by the fingers (or pressed to the chest) and streams it to a smartphone app for AF detection. (The 'Kardia Band' wrist-strap ECG accessory for Apple Watch followed in 2017, FDA cleared.)
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg
- **algorithms**: algo-afib-detection, algo-arrhythmia-classification, algo-hr
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a portable two-dry-electrode single-lead ECG recorder that the user contacts with the fingers (or chest) and that streams the trace to a smartphone for automated atrial-fibrillation detection — and, in the 2017 Kardia Band variant, the same dry-electrode single-lead ECG integrated into a wrist strap. Anticipates consumer single-lead-ECG and wrist-strap-ECG AF-detection claims from 2012/2017 — predating the Apple Watch Series 4 ECG (2018). Product-side anchor for the consumer-ECG cross-cut.

## FDA De Novo DEN180044 (2018) — over-the-counter electrocardiograph software for use in detecting atrial fibrillation (Apple Watch ECG app) (2018-09-11)

- **id**: `fda-den180044-apple-watch-ecg-app-2018`
- **corpus**: regulatory
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: U.S. Food and Drug Administration (CDRH); requester Apple Inc.
- **disclosure**: U.S. FDA, De Novo Classification Request DEN180044 (Apple Inc., 'ECG App'), granted 11 September 2018 — decision summary at accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/DEN180044.pdf; established a new FDA device classification for over-the-counter electrocardiograph software intended to acquire, store, transfer and display a single-lead (Lead I) ECG and to provide a rhythm classification (AFib vs. sinus rhythm) on a consumer wrist-worn platform, with general/special controls.
- **ip status**: regulatory-filing
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg
- **algorithms**: algo-afib-detection, algo-arrhythmia-classification
- **prior art notes**: A public, dated FDA decision describing — and creating the device class for — over-the-counter single-lead ECG software on a consumer wrist-worn device with on-device AFib-vs-sinus classification. As a government disclosure it establishes, as of 11 September 2018, the public availability of the device described: a wristworn Lead-I ECG with consumer-facing rhythm classification. Useful prior art for later claims to that combination; the De Novo decision summary also enumerates the clinical validation and the bench/algorithm characteristics, which are themselves citable. Pairs with the product entry [[apple-watch-series4-ecg-2018]] and the standard [[ieee-11073-10406-basic-ecg-2011]].

## FDA De Novo DEN180042 (2018) — photoplethysmograph analysis software for over-the-counter irregular-rhythm (possible-AFib) notification (Apple Watch) (2018-09-11)

- **id**: `fda-den180042-irregular-rhythm-notification-2018`
- **corpus**: regulatory
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: U.S. Food and Drug Administration (CDRH); requester Apple Inc.
- **disclosure**: U.S. FDA, De Novo Classification Request DEN180042 (Apple Inc., 'Irregular Rhythm Notification Feature'), granted 11 September 2018 — decision summary at accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/DEN180042.pdf; established a new FDA device classification for software that analyses pulse-rate data from a consumer wrist-worn photoplethysmography sensor, intermittently and in the background, to identify episodes of irregular heart rhythm suggestive of atrial fibrillation and notify the user, with general/special controls.
- **ip status**: regulatory-filing
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg
- **algorithms**: algo-afib-detection, algo-hr
- **prior art notes**: A public, dated FDA decision describing — and creating the device class for — background PPG-based screening for irregular heart rhythm / possible atrial fibrillation on a consumer wrist wearable, with user notification. Establishes as of 11 September 2018 the public availability of: a wrist-PPG device that intermittently analyses pulse-rate variability to flag possible AFib and notifies the wearer. Prior art for later claims to that combination; the decision summary's account of the algorithm and the Apple Heart Study validation is citable. Pairs with [[apple-watch-series4-ecg-2018]], [[allen-2007-ppg-review]], and the fictional AR-overlay antecedents are irrelevant here — this is enabling prior art.

## Apple Watch Series 4 (2018) — wrist single-lead ECG and PPG-based irregular-rhythm notification (2018-09-12)

- **id**: `apple-watch-series4-ecg-2018`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Apple Inc.
- **disclosure**: Apple Inc. 'Apple Watch Series 4', announced 12 September 2018 (ECG app and irregular rhythm notification feature enabled later in 2018) — a wristworn device taking a single-lead (Lead I) ECG between a back-crystal electrode and a Digital Crown electrode touched by the opposite hand, with on-device AF/sinus classification, plus a PPG-based irregular-rhythm (possible-AF) notification algorithm. FDA cleared via De Novo (ECG app: DEN180044; irregular rhythm notification: DEN180042).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-ppg
- **algorithms**: algo-afib-detection, algo-arrhythmia-classification, algo-hr
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a wristworn device that records a single-lead ECG between a watch-back electrode and a crown electrode touched by the contralateral hand, classifies the rhythm (AF vs. sinus) on-device, and separately runs a PPG-based background algorithm flagging possible atrial fibrillation. Anticipates wristworn-ECG and watch-AF-detection claims postdating September 2018; the underlying single-lead ECG and PPG-rhythm-screening techniques are much older ([[einthoven-1903-string-galvanometer-ecg]], [[holter-1961-ambulatory-ecg]], [[allen-2007-ppg-review]], [[ieee-11073-10406-basic-ecg-2011]]). Product-side anchor for the watch × ECG and watch × PPG × AF-detection cross-cuts.
