## Hertzman (1937) — photoelectric plethysmography (the origin of PPG) (1937)

- **id**: `hertzman-1937-photoplethysmography`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: other
- **creator**: Alrick B. Hertzman
- **disclosure**: Hertzman AB. 'Photoelectric plethysmography of the fingers and toes in man.' Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine 1937;37(3):529-534.
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg
- **prior art notes**: Coins and demonstrates 'photoelectric plethysmography' — measuring the pulsatile change in transmitted/reflected light through perfused tissue to track blood volume pulse. This is the disclosure root of the entire PPG wearable space: every claim reciting 'a photoplethysmography sensor' or 'a light source and a photodetector arranged to measure a blood volume pulse in tissue' reads on Hertzman 1937. As § 102 prior art for the bare PPG principle it is dispositive; combined with any form-factor disclosure it renders the form-factor+PPG combination obvious under [[obviousness-template]].

## Peñáz (1973) — the volume-clamp (vascular unloading) method of continuous finger blood pressure (1973)

- **id**: `penaz-1973-volume-clamp-finger-bp`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: other
- **creator**: Jan Peñáz
- **disclosure**: Peñáz J. 'Photoelectric measurement of blood pressure, volume and flow in the finger.' Digest of the 10th International Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering, Dresden, 1973, p. 104. (Basis of the Finapres / volume-clamp continuous BP monitors.)
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-cuffless-bp-volume-clamp, sensor-pressure-skin
- **algorithms**: algo-pwv-bp-estimation
- **prior art notes**: Discloses the volume-clamp / vascular-unloading method: a finger cuff servo-controlled by a photoplethysmographic feedback loop to hold the arterial volume constant, so the applied counter-pressure tracks the arterial pressure waveform continuously and non-invasively. Any cuffless/continuous-BP wearable claim reciting 'a photoplethysmographic feedback loop controlling an applied pressure to maintain constant vascular volume' reads on Peñáz 1973. Anchor for the volume-clamp cuffless-BP cross-cut (the finger/ring form-factor variants are obvious combinations under [[obviousness-template]]).

## Aoyagi (1974) — two-wavelength pulse oximetry principle (1974)

- **id**: `aoyagi-1974-two-wavelength-pulse-oximetry`
- **corpus**: private

- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-spo2, sensor-ppg, sensor-multi-wavelength-ppg
- **algorithms**: algo-spo2-estimation
- **prior art notes**: Discloses the pulsatile two-wavelength ratiometric method that underlies every non-invasive SpO2 device: comparing the AC/DC ratios of light absorbance at (typically) red ~660 nm and infrared ~940 nm through pulsatile tissue to compute arterial oxygen saturation. Any wearable claim reciting 'a first and second light source at distinct wavelengths and a photodetector configured to compute oxygen saturation from a ratio of pulsatile components' reads on this. § 102 prior art for the SpO2 principle from 1974; the wrist/ring/earbud form-factor variants are obvious combinations under [[obviousness-template]].

## Geddes et al. (1981) — pulse transit time as an indicator of arterial blood pressure (1981-01)

- **id**: `geddes-1981-pulse-transit-time-bp`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: other

- **disclosure**: Geddes LA, Voelz MH, Babbs CF, Bourland JD, Tacker WA. 'Pulse transit time as an indicator of arterial blood pressure.' Psychophysiology 1981;18(1):71-74.
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-ppg, sensor-cuffless-bp-ptt
- **algorithms**: algo-pwv-bp-estimation
- **prior art notes**: Establishes that pulse transit time — the delay between a proximal timing reference (e.g. the ECG R-wave) and the arrival of the pulse at a distal site (e.g. a finger PPG) — varies inversely with arterial blood pressure, and can therefore be used to estimate BP without a cuff. Any cuffless-BP wearable claim reciting 'estimating blood pressure from a pulse transit time (or pulse arrival time / pulse wave velocity) derived from two physiological signals' reads on Geddes 1981. Earliest anchor for the PTT-cuffless-BP cross-cut; [[mukkamala-2015-ptt-cuffless-bp-review]] is the modern survey.

- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-multi-wavelength-ppg
- **algorithms**: algo-spo2-estimation, algo-hr
- **prior art notes**: Establishes pulse oximetry by reflectance (light source and detector on the same side of the tissue) rather than transmission — the geometry every wrist, forehead, ring, chest, and earbud PPG/SpO2 wearable uses, since those sites cannot be transilluminated. Any wearable-SpO2 claim reciting 'a reflectance photoplethysmography sensor' or 'a light source and photodetector arranged on a common surface against the skin' reads on Mendelson & Ochs 1988. Anchor for the reflectance-PPG/SpO2 cross-cut on non-fingertip sites.

Any wearable claim reciting 'computing a heart-rate-variability metric (e.g. RMSSD, LF/HF) from a sequence of interbeat intervals' rests on metrics standardized here. Anchor for the HRV cross-cut; applicable whether the interbeat intervals come from ECG or PPG.
