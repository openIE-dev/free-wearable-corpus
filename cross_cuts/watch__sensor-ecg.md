- **id**: `polar-sport-tester-pe2000-1982`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Polar Electro Oy (Seppo Säynäjäkangas)
- **disclosure**: Polar Electro Oy. 'Sport Tester PE2000' wrist heart-rate monitor, introduced 1982 — a chest electrode strap transmitting ECG-derived heart rate wirelessly to a wrist-worn receiver/display. Underlying invention: Seppo Säynäjäkangas, wireless heart-rate measurement, patents filed from c. 1977 (Polar Electro).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg
- **algorithms**: algo-hr
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a body-worn heart-rate monitoring system: a chest strap with electrodes deriving heart rate from the ECG and transmitting it wirelessly to a wrist-worn receiver that displays it. Anticipates claims combining 'a chest-worn electrode assembly sensing heart rate' and 'wireless transmission to a wrist-worn display' (the chest-strap-plus-watch architecture), and the bare 'wristworn heart-rate display' concept, from 1982 (invention c. 1977). Anchor for the wristworn-HR cross-cut on the product side; [[bluetooth-sig-heart-rate-profile-2011]] later standardized the comms link.
