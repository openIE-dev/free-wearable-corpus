## MIT wearable ring sensor (Rhee, Yang, Asada) — finger-ring PPG for ambulatory monitoring (2001-07)

- **id**: `asada-mit-wearable-ring-sensor-2003`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: ring
- **creator**: Sokwoo Rhee / Boo-Ho Yang / Haruhiko Harry Asada (MIT d'Arbeloff Lab)
- **disclosure**: Rhee S, Yang B-H, Asada HH. 'Artifact-resistant power-efficient design of finger-ring plethysmographic sensors.' IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 2001;48(7):795-805 (and Asada HH, Shaltis P, Reisner A, Rhee S, Hutchinson RC. 'Mobile monitoring with wearable photoplethysmographic biosensors.' IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine 2003;22(3):28-40).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-spo2-estimation
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a finger-ring-form-factor wearable PPG sensor with motion-artifact-resistant optical/mechanical design, low-power operation, on-body processing, and wireless telemetry of heart rate and SpO2 for ambulatory monitoring — i.e. the smart-ring physiological monitor, ~14 years before the commercial smart-ring wave. Directly anticipates ring-form claims combining 'a ring body', 'a PPG emitter/detector at the inner ring surface', 'motion-artifact compensation', and 'wireless transmission of derived vitals'. Anchor for the ring × PPG cross-cut; [[oura-ring-gen1-2015]] and similar products descend from it.

- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-arrhythmia-classification, algo-spo2-estimation, algo-fall-detection, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Surveys, as of 2010, the architecture and components of wearable health-monitoring systems — sensors (ECG, PPG, SpO2, accelerometry, temperature, respiration), garment- and patch- and watch-based form factors, on-body processing, wireless body-area networking, and the analytics (arrhythmia, fall, activity, deterioration prediction). Prior art establishing that the general 'multi-sensor wearable + body-area network + cloud analytics' system architecture and its building blocks were collected and published by 2010 — useful against later claims to the bare system architecture. General anchor.

## Bragi Dash (2014) — the first true 'hearable': in-ear PPG heart rate, accelerometer, storage and touch control inside wireless earbuds (2014-02-25)

- **id**: `bragi-dash-2014`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: earbud
- **creator**: Bragi GmbH
- **disclosure**: Bragi GmbH. 'The Dash' wireless smart earphones, crowdfunded February 2014 (shipped 2016) — fully wireless in-ear earbuds with a reflectance-PPG heart-rate sensor and oxygen-saturation estimation against the ear-canal wall, a 3-axis accelerometer (head-gesture and step/activity tracking), 4 GB onboard music storage, bone-conduction microphone, and capacitive touch control.
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-microphone-bone

- **prior art notes**: Discloses fully-wireless in-ear earbuds with a reflectance-PPG heart-rate and SpO2 sensor against the ear-canal wall, an accelerometer for head-gesture and step/activity tracking, onboard music storage, a bone-conduction microphone, and capacitive touch control — i.e. physiological sensing integrated into wireless earbuds. Anticipates hearable claims combining 'a wireless earbud housing', 'an in-ear PPG/SpO2 sensor', 'an accelerometer for activity or head gesture', and 'on-device media and controls' from 2014. Product-side anchor for the earbud × PPG cross-cut.

## Withings ScanWatch (2020) — hybrid analog watch with PPG, SpO2 pulse oximetry, single-lead ECG, and accelerometer (2020-01-05)

- **id**: `withings-scanwatch-2020`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Withings SA
- **disclosure**: Withings (Nokia/Withings). 'ScanWatch', announced January 2020 (CE-marked 2020; FDA cleared 2022) — a hybrid analog wristwatch integrating a reflectance-PPG sensor (heart rate, irregular-rhythm screening), an SpO2 (pulse-oximetry) measurement, a single-lead ECG (back electrode plus a bezel electrode touched by the opposite hand, with AF detection), a 3-axis accelerometer, and an altimeter — with sleep and activity tracking.

Anticipates multi-modal medical-smartwatch claims reciting combinations of wrist PPG-HR + wrist SpO2 + single-lead ECG from 2020. Product-side anchor for the watch × {PPG, SpO2, ECG} multi-sensor cross-cut.

- **creator**: Masimo Corp.
- **disclosure**: Masimo Corp. 'Masimo W1' health-tracking watch, announced May 2022 — a wrist-worn device performing continuous medical-grade pulse oximetry (SpO2), pulse rate, perfusion index (PI), pleth variability index (PVi), respiratory rate from the PPG, and HRV, using Masimo's SET/rainbow signal-extraction algorithms. (FDA cleared as a continuous-monitoring medical device.)
