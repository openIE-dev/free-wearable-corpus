## Microsoft Band (2014) — ten-sensor wristband (optical HR, GPS, GSR, UV, skin temp, barometer, ambient light, capacitive, microphone, IMU) (2014-10-30)

- **id**: `microsoft-band-2014`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Microsoft Corp.
- **disclosure**: Microsoft Corp. 'Microsoft Band', released 30 October 2014 — a wristband integrating ten sensors: an optical (PPG) heart-rate sensor, a 3-axis accelerometer/gyroscope, GPS, an ambient-light sensor, a skin-temperature sensor, a UV sensor, a capacitive (wear-detection) sensor, a galvanic-skin-response sensor, a microphone, and a barometer (added in Band 2).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-gyroscope, sensor-skin-temperature, sensor-uv, sensor-gsr, sensor-barometer, sensor-photodiode-ambient, sensor-microphone-air
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-step-count, algo-calorie-estimation, algo-sleep-staging, algo-stress-index, algo-uv-dose-tracking
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a single wristband integrating an unusually broad sensor suite — reflectance-PPG HR, IMU, GPS, skin temperature, UV exposure, galvanic skin response (electrodermal activity), barometer, ambient light, capacitive wear-detection, and a microphone — feeding HR, activity, sleep, UV dose, and stress-index estimations. Prior art for multi-sensor-wristband claims reciting combinations of these sensors (notably wrist GSR/EDA + PPG + skin temperature for stress) from October 2014. Product-side anchor for the multi-sensor wristband cross-cut.

## FDA 510(k) K181861 (2018) — Empatica Embrace physiological-signal-based seizure monitoring system (2018)

- **id**: `fda-k181861-empatica-embrace-seizure-system-2018`
- **corpus**: regulatory
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: U.S. Food and Drug Administration (CDRH); submitter Empatica Inc.
- **disclosure**: U.S. FDA, 510(k) Premarket Notification K181861 (Empatica Inc., 'Embrace' physiological-signal-based seizure monitoring system) — a wrist-worn device using accelerometry plus electrodermal activity to detect probable generalized tonic-clonic seizures and alert caregivers; reported as the first FDA-cleared smartwatch indicated for use in neurology (clearance announced February 2018). (Verify which Embrace generation K181861 maps to; the original clearance may carry a different K-number.)
- **ip status**: regulatory-filing
- **sensors**: sensor-accelerometer, sensor-gsr
- **algorithms**: algo-seizure-detection
- **prior art notes**: A public, dated FDA record of a wrist-worn device detecting probable generalized tonic-clonic seizures from combined accelerometry and electrodermal activity, with caregiver alerting — the non-EEG route to wearable seizure detection. Establishes the public availability of that device as of 2018; the 510(k) cites a predicate chain that is itself prior art. Prior art for wrist-based seizure-detection claims using motion + EDA; regulatory anchor pairing with [[empatica-embrace2-seizure-watch-2018]] (the EEG route is anchored separately by [[zanetti-aminifar-atienza-eglass-2025]] and [[chb-mit-scalp-eeg-database-2009]]).

## Empatica Embrace2 (2018) — first FDA-cleared seizure-monitoring smartwatch (accelerometer + electrodermal activity) (2018-01-31)

- **id**: `empatica-embrace2-seizure-watch-2018`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Empatica Inc. (Rosalind Picard, Matteo Lai, et al.)
- **disclosure**: Empatica Inc. 'Embrace2' smartwatch, FDA-cleared January 2018 — a wrist-worn device with a 3-axis accelerometer/gyroscope, an electrodermal-activity (EDA) sensor, and a peripheral skin-temperature sensor, running an on-device classifier that detects probable generalized tonic-clonic seizures from the combined motion + EDA signature and alerts caregivers; the first FDA-cleared smartwatch for seizure monitoring. (Descends from the MIT Media Lab 'iCalm'/'Q sensor' EDA wristband research, Picard et al.)
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-accelerometer, sensor-gyroscope, sensor-gsr, sensor-skin-temperature
- **algorithms**: algo-seizure-detection, algo-stress-index, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a wristworn device that detects probable generalized tonic-clonic seizures by combining a motion (accelerometer/gyroscope) signature with an electrodermal-activity (sympathetic-surge) signature in an on-device classifier, and alerts caregivers — i.e. multimodal wrist-based seizure detection, distinct from the EEG-based approach. Anticipates wrist-seizure-detection claims combining 'a wrist-worn accelerometer and an electrodermal-activity sensor' and 'a classifier flagging a seizure from their combined signal' from 2018. Product-side anchor for the wrist × seizure-detection cross-cut; complementary to the EEG route in [[zanetti-aminifar-atienza-eglass-2025]] and [[chb-mit-scalp-eeg-database-2009]].

## HealthyPi Move (ProtoCentral, 2026) — open-source medical-grade smartwatch (2024)

- **prior art notes**: Discloses, as fully open-source hardware and firmware (CC and MIT-style licensing across components), a wrist-worn smartwatch with the full consumer-medical sensor stack: single-lead ECG between back-of-watch electrode and a finger-touch electrode; multi-wavelength reflectance PPG with SpO2 and BP-trending; EDA/GSR; skin temperature; 6-axis IMU; on-device Zephyr-RTOS application; AMOLED display; all-local data storage via cross-platform Flutter app. Anticipates wrist-multi-sensor-watch claims from 2024-2026 to the extent they recite combinations of these elements; as `open` prior art it is unencumbered and any patent claim reciting these combinations must distinguish over HealthyPi Move's specific implementation. The product-side anchor for the 'open watch with the full sensor stack' cross-cut.
