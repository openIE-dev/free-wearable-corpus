## Garmin Forerunner 201 (2003) — wristworn GPS running watch with pace/distance and heart-rate (strap) integration (2003)

- **id**: `garmin-forerunner-201-2003`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Garmin Ltd.
- **disclosure**: Garmin Ltd. 'Forerunner 101/201', introduced 2003 — a wrist-worn GPS receiver/watch logging pace, distance, route, and (with a paired chest strap) heart rate, with workout history and a web/PC sync. Later Garmin watches (Fenix/Forerunner with the 'Elevate' optical sensor, c. 2015) moved heart rate, and subsequently SpO2 (pulse ox) and respiration, onto the wrist.
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-accelerometer, sensor-ecg, sensor-ppg
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-step-count, algo-calorie-estimation, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a wrist-worn GPS sport watch deriving pace, distance, and route, integrating heart rate from a paired electrode chest strap, and syncing workout history to a host — and, in later Garmin models, on-wrist optical-PPG heart rate, SpO2, and respiration. Anticipates GPS-sport-watch claims from 2003 and (for the later models) wrist-optical-vitals claims. Product-side anchor for the watch × GPS-fitness cross-cut.

## Paradiso et al. (2005) — 'A wearable health care system based on knitted integrated sensors' (WEALTHY) (2005-09)

- **id**: `paradiso-2005-wealthy-knitted-smart-shirt`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: garment
- **creator**: Rita Paradiso / Giannicola Loriga / Nicola Taccini (Smartex / CNR, Italy; EU WEALTHY consortium)
- **disclosure**: Paradiso R, Loriga G, Taccini N. 'A wearable health care system based on knitted integrated sensors.' IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine 2005;9(3):337-344. (Output of the EU FP5 'WEALTHY' project, 2002-2005.)
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-respiration-impedance, sensor-piezoelectric, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-skin-temperature
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-respiratory-rate, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a smart shirt with electrodes and sensors knitted directly into the textile (conductive yarns forming dry ECG electrodes; piezoresistive yarns forming respiration sensors via thoracic/abdominal expansion; accelerometer; temperature) plus an on-garment electronic interface and wireless link, deriving ECG, heart rate, respiration, posture/activity, and temperature — i.e. a fully integrated textile-electrode wearable. Any claim reciting 'an item of clothing with electrodes/sensors integrated into the fabric structure for physiological monitoring' reads on Paradiso 2005. Anchor for the garment × textile-electrode cross-cut; the foundational EU project for the smart-shirt patent space (Hexoskin, Cityzen, etc. all build on this lineage).

## Pantelopoulos & Bourbakis (2010) — survey on wearable sensor-based systems for health monitoring and prognosis (2010-01)

- **disclosure**: Pantelopoulos A, Bourbakis NG. 'A survey on wearable sensor-based systems for health monitoring and prognosis.' IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews) 2010;40(1):1-12.
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-skin-temperature, sensor-respiration-impedance
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-arrhythmia-classification, algo-spo2-estimation, algo-fall-detection, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Surveys, as of 2010, the architecture and components of wearable health-monitoring systems — sensors (ECG, PPG, SpO2, accelerometry, temperature, respiration), garment- and patch- and watch-based form factors, on-body processing, wireless body-area networking, and the analytics (arrhythmia, fall, activity, deterioration prediction). Prior art establishing that the general 'multi-sensor wearable + body-area network + cloud analytics' system architecture and its building blocks were collected and published by 2010 — useful against later claims to the bare system architecture. General anchor.

Prior art for wearable movement-disorder and gait-monitoring claims reciting any of the placements/analytics surveyed; collected and published by 2012. General anchor for the gait / tremor / activity cross-cuts.
