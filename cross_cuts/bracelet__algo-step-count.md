## Fitbit Tracker (2009) — clip-on accelerometer activity and sleep monitor (2009-10)

- **id**: `fitbit-tracker-2009`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: pendant
- **creator**: Fitbit, Inc. (James Park, Eric Friedman)
- **disclosure**: Fitbit, Inc. 'Fitbit Tracker', launched October 2009 — a clip-worn device with a 3-axis accelerometer estimating steps, distance, calories burned, active minutes, and sleep quality, syncing wirelessly to a web dashboard. (The wrist PPG heart-rate variant, Fitbit Charge HR, followed in January 2015.)
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-step-count, algo-calorie-estimation, algo-activity-classification, algo-sleep-staging
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a small body-worn (clip) device with a 3-axis accelerometer that estimates step count, distance, calories, active minutes, and sleep quality on-device and syncs wirelessly to a cloud dashboard. Anticipates consumer-activity-tracker claims combining 'a body-worn accelerometer', 'on-device estimation of steps/calories/activity/sleep', and 'wireless sync to a remote service' from 2009. Anchor for the step-count and consumer-sleep-tracking cross-cuts on the product side.

## The Circle — 'SeeChange' wearable cameras and employee health wristbands (2013-10-08)

- **id**: `the-circle-seechange-and-health-wristbands`
- **corpus**: fictional
- **form factor**: bracelet
- **creator**: Dave Eggers
- **disclosure**: Eggers, Dave. The Circle. Alfred A. Knopf, 2013 (film adaptation 2017); 'SeeChange' miniature wearable/mountable cameras streaming continuously, and employee wristbands (worn in pairs on each wrist) that continuously monitor heart rate, activity, sleep, and other physiological data and upload it to the company.
- **ip status**: fictional
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-camera-rgb
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-step-count, algo-sleep-staging
- **prior art notes**: Discloses (a) continuously-worn wristbands with PPG and motion sensing that stream heart rate, activity, and sleep data to an employer, and (b) tiny body-wearable always-streaming cameras. Relevant to workplace-wellness wearable claims combining 'a wrist-worn PPG/motion sensor', 'continuous physiological streaming to a remote/employer system', and to body-worn-camera streaming claims. § 103 motivation that the employer-monitored wrist wearable and the always-streaming wearable camera were articulated objectives by 2013.

## Microsoft Band (2014) — ten-sensor wristband (optical HR, GPS, GSR, UV, skin temp, barometer, ambient light, capacitive, microphone, IMU) (2014-10-30)

- **id**: `microsoft-band-2014`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Microsoft Corp.
- **disclosure**: Microsoft Corp. 'Microsoft Band', released 30 October 2014 — a wristband integrating ten sensors: an optical (PPG) heart-rate sensor, a 3-axis accelerometer/gyroscope, GPS, an ambient-light sensor, a skin-temperature sensor, a UV sensor, a capacitive (wear-detection) sensor, a galvanic-skin-response sensor, a microphone, and a barometer (added in Band 2).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-gyroscope, sensor-skin-temperature, sensor-uv, sensor-gsr, sensor-barometer, sensor-photodiode-ambient, sensor-microphone-air
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-step-count, algo-calorie-estimation, algo-sleep-staging, algo-stress-index, algo-uv-dose-tracking
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a single wristband integrating an unusually broad sensor suite — reflectance-PPG HR, IMU, GPS, skin temperature, UV exposure, galvanic skin response (electrodermal activity), barometer, ambient light, capacitive wear-detection, and a microphone — feeding HR, activity, sleep, UV dose, and stress-index estimations. Prior art for multi-sensor-wristband claims reciting combinations of these sensors (notably wrist GSR/EDA + PPG + skin temperature for stress) from October 2014. Product-side anchor for the multi-sensor wristband cross-cut.

## Fitbit Charge HR (2015) — wristband with continuous wrist-PPG heart rate ('PurePulse') (2015-01-06)

- **id**: `fitbit-charge-hr-2015`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Fitbit, Inc.
- **disclosure**: Fitbit, Inc. 'Fitbit Charge HR', announced January 2015 — a wristband with 'PurePulse' continuous optical (green-LED PPG) heart rate, a 3-axis accelerometer, steps/distance/floors/calories/active-minutes, automatic sleep tracking, and call/text notifications.
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-barometer
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-step-count, algo-calorie-estimation, algo-activity-classification, algo-sleep-staging
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a wristband with continuous green-LED reflectance-PPG heart rate plus accelerometry and an altimeter, deriving HR, steps, floors, calories, and sleep, with phone notifications. A mainstream realization of [[mendelson-ochs-1988-reflectance-pulse-oximetry]]-geometry wrist PPG; anticipates wrist-PPG-HR-band claims from January 2015. Product-side anchor for the watch × PPG cross-cut alongside [[apple-watch-original-2015]].
