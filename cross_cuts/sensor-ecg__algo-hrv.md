## Task Force of the ESC and NASPE (1996) — heart rate variability: standards of measurement (1996-03)

- **id**: `esc-naspe-1996-hrv-standards`
- **corpus**: standards
- **form factor**: other
- **creator**: Task Force of the ESC and NASPE
- **disclosure**: Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology. 'Heart rate variability: standards of measurement, physiological interpretation, and clinical use.' Circulation 1996;93(5):1043-1065 (also European Heart Journal 1996;17:354-381).
- **ip status**: standards
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-ppg
- **algorithms**: algo-hrv, algo-stress-index
- **prior art notes**: Standardizes the time-domain (SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, ...) and frequency-domain (VLF/LF/HF, LF/HF ratio) measures of heart rate variability, their computation from an interbeat-interval series, and their physiological interpretation. Any wearable claim reciting 'computing a heart-rate-variability metric (e.g. RMSSD, LF/HF) from a sequence of interbeat intervals' rests on metrics standardized here. Anchor for the HRV cross-cut; applicable whether the interbeat intervals come from ECG or PPG.

## Hexoskin smart shirt (2014) — textile-integrated ECG, respiration and activity garment (2013)

- **id**: `hexoskin-smart-shirt-2014`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: garment
- **creator**: Carre Technologies Inc.
- **disclosure**: Carre Technologies Inc. (Hexoskin). 'Hexoskin Smart Shirt', introduced 2013 (consumer); a compression shirt with knitted dry textile electrodes for single-lead ECG, two-channel respiratory inductive plethysmography (thoracic + abdominal expansion), a 3-axis accelerometer, and a removable electronics pod, deriving HR, HRV, breathing rate/volume, cadence, steps, and sleep. (Used in NASA/CSA 'Astroskin' studies.)
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-respiration-impedance, sensor-piezoelectric, sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-respiratory-rate, algo-activity-classification, algo-sleep-staging
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a consumer/research compression shirt with textile-integrated dry ECG electrodes, two-channel respiratory inductive plethysmography (thoracic + abdominal), an accelerometer, and a removable electronics pod, deriving HR, HRV, breathing rate and volume, activity, and sleep. A commercial realization of [[paradiso-2005-wealthy-knitted-smart-shirt]]; anticipates smart-shirt claims combining 'textile-integrated ECG and respiration sensors' and 'a detachable electronics module' from 2013. Product-side anchor for the garment × textile-electrode cross-cut.

## VitalConnect VitalPatch (2016) — adhesive chest patch with single-lead ECG and multi-parameter monitoring (2016)

- **id**: `vitalconnect-vitalpatch-2016`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: patch
- **creator**: VitalConnect, Inc.
- **disclosure**: VitalConnect, Inc. 'VitalPatch' biosensor, FDA-cleared as a single-use adhesive chest patch with single-lead ECG, heart rate, heart-rate variability, respiratory rate, skin temperature, posture, activity, and fall detection, streamed wirelessly to a smartphone/relay; 7-day wear (later 14-day variants).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-skin-temperature
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-respiratory-rate, algo-activity-classification, algo-posture-detection, algo-fall-detection, algo-arrhythmia-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a single-use adhesive chest patch deriving single-lead ECG, HR, HRV, respiratory rate, skin temperature, posture, activity, and falls in one body-worn unit, streamed wirelessly — i.e. a packed multi-parameter vital-signs patch. Anticipates multi-parameter ECG-patch claims combining any subset of those measurements in one adhesive form factor from 2016. Product-side anchor for the patch × multi-parameter-vitals cross-cut alongside [[fda-k113862-irhythm-zio-patch-2011]] (the AFib-focused variant).

## Polar H10 (2017) — research-grade chest-strap ECG heart-rate sensor (2017-01)

- **id**: `polar-h10-chest-strap-2017`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: garment
- **creator**: Polar Electro Oy
- **disclosure**: Polar Electro Oy. 'Polar H10' chest heart-rate sensor, released 2017 — a chest strap with two dry electrodes deriving a single-lead ECG, computing R-R intervals and heart rate, with onboard 1-session memory, dual-broadcast (BLE + ANT+ + 5 kHz GymLink), an accelerometer (relative orientation), and well-documented R-R-interval accuracy (often used as a gold-standard reference for consumer wearables).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ecg, sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-arrhythmia-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a chest strap with two dry electrodes deriving single-lead ECG, with on-strap R-R-interval computation, multi-protocol broadcast (BLE + ANT+ + the 5 kHz GymLink legacy band), and accelerometer-assisted noise rejection. Anticipates chest-strap-ECG claims combining 'dry textile/elastic chest electrodes', 'on-strap derivation of R-R intervals and HR', and 'multi-protocol simultaneous wireless broadcast' from 2017. Product-side anchor for the garment/patch × ECG strap cross-cut; refines [[polar-sport-tester-pe2000-1982]].
