## Mendelson & Ochs (1988) — reflectance-mode pulse oximetry / skin-reflectance PPG (1988-10)

- **id**: `mendelson-ochs-1988-reflectance-pulse-oximetry`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: other
- **creator**: Yitzhak Mendelson / Burt D. Ochs
- **disclosure**: Mendelson Y, Ochs BD. 'Noninvasive pulse oximetry utilizing skin reflectance photoplethysmography.' IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 1988;35(10):798-805.
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-multi-wavelength-ppg
- **algorithms**: algo-spo2-estimation, algo-hr
- **prior art notes**: Establishes pulse oximetry by reflectance (light source and detector on the same side of the tissue) rather than transmission — the geometry every wrist, forehead, ring, chest, and earbud PPG/SpO2 wearable uses, since those sites cannot be transilluminated. Any wearable-SpO2 claim reciting 'a reflectance photoplethysmography sensor' or 'a light source and photodetector arranged on a common surface against the skin' reads on Mendelson & Ochs 1988. Anchor for the reflectance-PPG/SpO2 cross-cut on non-fingertip sites.

## Pantelopoulos & Bourbakis (2010) — survey on wearable sensor-based systems for health monitoring and prognosis (2010-01)

- **prior art notes**: Surveys, as of 2010, the architecture and components of wearable health-monitoring systems — sensors (ECG, PPG, SpO2, accelerometry, temperature, respiration), garment- and patch- and watch-based form factors, on-body processing, wireless body-area networking, and the analytics (arrhythmia, fall, activity, deterioration prediction). Prior art establishing that the general 'multi-sensor wearable + body-area network + cloud analytics' system architecture and its building blocks were collected and published by 2010 — useful against later claims to the bare system architecture. General anchor.

Prior art for cuffless-BP wearable claims reciting any of the configurations or calibration approaches surveyed here — they were collected, modeled, and published by 2015. Combined with watch/ring/patch form-factor disclosures, makes wearable PTT-based BP an obvious combination under [[obviousness-template]].
