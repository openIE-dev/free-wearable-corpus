- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Masimo Corp.
- **disclosure**: Masimo Corp. 'Masimo W1' health-tracking watch, announced May 2022 — a wrist-worn device performing continuous medical-grade pulse oximetry (SpO2), pulse rate, perfusion index (PI), pleth variability index (PVi), respiratory rate from the PPG, and HRV, using Masimo's SET/rainbow signal-extraction algorithms. (FDA cleared as a continuous-monitoring medical device.)
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-spo2, sensor-multi-wavelength-ppg, sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-spo2-estimation, algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-respiratory-rate
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a wrist-worn device performing continuous medical-grade pulse oximetry — SpO2, PR, perfusion index, PVi, RR-from-PPG, HRV — using established signal-extraction methods, distinguished from consumer spot-check SpO2 by continuous operation and clearance for medical use. Anticipates wrist-continuous-medical-SpO2 claims from 2022; the underlying two-wavelength SpO2 method is much older ([[aoyagi-1974-two-wavelength-pulse-oximetry]], [[mendelson-ochs-1988-reflectance-pulse-oximetry]], [[iso-80601-2-61-pulse-oximeter-equipment-2011]]). Product-side anchor for the watch × continuous-SpO2 cross-cut.

- **id**: `ultrahuman-ring-air-2023`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: ring
- **creator**: Ultrahuman Healthcare Pvt. Ltd.
- **disclosure**: Ultrahuman Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. 'Ultrahuman Ring AIR', launched 2023 — a titanium smart ring with infrared photoplethysmography, IR skin-temperature, and a 6-axis IMU, deriving HR, HRV, skin temperature, sleep staging, activity, and metabolic-health framing (paired with the company's CGM-based metabolism platform).
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-skin-temperature, sensor-accelerometer, sensor-gyroscope
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-sleep-staging, algo-respiratory-rate
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a smart ring with IR PPG, skin-temperature, and a 6-axis IMU, deriving HR/HRV, sleep, and activity, packaged with a metabolic-health platform (CGM-linked). Product-side reference in the ring × PPG cross-cut alongside [[oura-ring-gen1-2015]] and [[samsung-galaxy-ring-2024]].

## Samsung Galaxy Ring (2024) — smart ring with PPG, skin temperature and accelerometer for HR/HRV, sleep and cycle tracking (2024-07-10)

- **id**: `samsung-galaxy-ring-2024`
- **corpus**: private
- **form factor**: ring
- **creator**: Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
- **disclosure**: Samsung Electronics. 'Samsung Galaxy Ring', announced July 2024 — a finger ring with infrared photoplethysmography, an IR skin-temperature sensor, and a 3-axis accelerometer, deriving heart rate, heart-rate variability, skin temperature, sleep staging, activity, snore detection, and (with cycle-tracking) menstrual-cycle predictions.
- **ip status**: patented
- **sensors**: sensor-ppg, sensor-skin-temperature, sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-hr, algo-hrv, algo-respiratory-rate, algo-sleep-staging, algo-snore-detection, algo-step-count
- **prior art notes**: Discloses a smart ring with infrared PPG, IR skin-temperature, and accelerometer, deriving HR/HRV, sleep, snore detection, activity, and menstrual-cycle prediction — a Samsung entry directly in the wake of [[oura-ring-gen1-2015]] and the [[asada-mit-wearable-ring-sensor-2003]] academic root. Product-side reference in the ring × PPG × HRV cross-cut alongside Oura.
