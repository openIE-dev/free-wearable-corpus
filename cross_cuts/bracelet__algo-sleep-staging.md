## Cole & Kripke et al. (1992) — automatic sleep/wake identification from wrist activity (the Cole-Kripke algorithm) (1992)

- **id**: `cole-kripke-1992-wrist-actigraphy-sleep`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Roger J. Cole / Daniel F. Kripke et al.
- **disclosure**: Cole RJ, Kripke DF, Gruen W, Mullaney DJ, Gillin JC. 'Automatic sleep/wake identification from wrist activity.' Sleep 1992;15(5):461-469.
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-sleep-staging, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: Discloses an algorithm that classifies each epoch as sleep or wake from a wrist-worn activity (accelerometer) recording, validated against polysomnography — i.e. wrist actigraphy as a wearable sleep monitor. Any consumer-wearable claim reciting 'estimating sleep/wake state from a wrist-worn accelerometer signal' (the method underlying Fitbit/Jawbone-class sleep tracking) reads on Cole-Kripke 1992. Anchor for the accelerometry sleep-staging cross-cut; combined with the wrist form factor it makes wristworn sleep tracking obvious under [[obviousness-template]].

## Sadeh et al. (1994) — activity-based sleep-wake identification (the Sadeh algorithm) (1994)

- **id**: `sadeh-1994-actigraphy-sleep-wake-algorithm`
- **corpus**: academic
- **form factor**: watch
- **creator**: Avi Sadeh / Katherine M. Sharkey / Mary A. Carskadon
- **disclosure**: Sadeh A, Sharkey KM, Carskadon MA. 'Activity-based sleep-wake identification: an empirical test of methodological issues.' Sleep 1994;17(3):201-207.
- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-sleep-staging, algo-activity-classification
- **prior art notes**: A second widely-used wrist-actigraphy sleep/wake scoring algorithm, with explicit treatment of the methodological choices (epoch length, scoring window, scaling). Prior art alongside [[cole-kripke-1992-wrist-actigraphy-sleep]] for any wearable claim reciting an actigraphy-based sleep-detection method or its parameters; both were published and validated by 1994.

## Ancoli-Israel et al. (2003) — 'The role of actigraphy in the study of sleep and circadian rhythms' (2003-05)

- **ip status**: public-domain
- **sensors**: sensor-accelerometer
- **algorithms**: algo-sleep-staging
- **prior art notes**: Authoritative review establishing wrist actigraphy — a wrist-worn accelerometer/activity recorder analyzed by validated algorithms — as an accepted method for estimating sleep parameters and circadian rhythm. Prior art for the proposition that a wrist-worn motion sensor with appropriate scoring yields clinically meaningful sleep metrics; the field, methods, and validation were settled and reviewed by 2003.

- **prior art notes**: Discloses a small body-worn (clip) device with a 3-axis accelerometer that estimates step count, distance, calories, active minutes, and sleep quality on-device and syncs wirelessly to a cloud dashboard. Anticipates consumer-activity-tracker claims combining 'a body-worn accelerometer', 'on-device estimation of steps/calories/activity/sleep', and 'wireless sync to a remote service' from 2009. Anchor for the step-count and consumer-sleep-tracking cross-cuts on the product side.
